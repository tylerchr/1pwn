# Package `hibp`

You probably don't want to use this code. Instead you should use [github.com/phlipse/hibpgo](https://github.com/phlipse/hibpgo) for a nice solid HIBP API. I wrote this up before I found out that existed.

Eventually I might submit a PR to add Range functionality to that package, but it wasn't immediately obvious how to integrate it without sacrificing the caching semantics I needed.
